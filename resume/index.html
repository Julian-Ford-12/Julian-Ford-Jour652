    <h4>Dolcezza Coffee and Gelato</h4> 
    <h5>February 2024 – August 2024</h5>
    
    <p>I provided coffee, gelato, and various pastry dishes to customers. I also managed the sales floor, 
    keeping both the dining area and the back offices clean.</p>
    
    <h3>Legal Assistant</h3>
    <h4>Hoffpauir Law, LLC</h4>
    <h5>January 2023 – January 2024</h5>
    
    <p>I filed forms, compiled immigration filings, and finalized cases for the United States Citizenship and Immigration
    Services. On the client-facing end, I met with clients, discussed their cases, and continuously worked on
    several cases over the span of several months. Occasionally, I also went in-person to the various 
    circuit and district courts in Rockville, MD to receive copies of legal documents and cases. </p>
    
    <h3>Tutor</h3>
    <h4>Tutor Doctor</h4>
    <h5>September 2023 – June 2024</h5>
    
    <p>I reviewed work with my assigned students, revised essays, and coached the students towards productive organizational
    skills. I also scheduled lesson plans, cultivated study habits, and used the study resources provided by Tutor Doctor 
    to engage the students in their work.</p>
    
    <h3>Freelance Journalist</h3>
    <h4>Washington City Paper</h4>
    <h5>June 2023 – August 2024</h5>
    
    <p>I researched the local DC area for article topics and stories, compiled pitches to send to the City Paper editors, 
    and conducted extensive research on the background of each article subject. I was also responsible for sourcing and
    scheduling interviews via emails, work sources, cold calling, and on-site visits to museums and live venues. Along 
    with these responsibilities I reliably researched, composed, edited, and published articles within a timely 
    fashion according to City Paper guidelines.</p>
    
    <h3>Freelance Journalist</h3>

    <h5>December 2022 – August 2024</h5>
    
    <p>I researched the local Baltimore area for article topics and stories, compiled pitches to send to the Fishbowl editors, 
    and conducted extensive research on the background of each article subject. I was also responsible for sourcing and 
    scheduling interviews via emails, work sources, cold calling, and on-site visits to museums and live venues. 
    Along with these responsibilities I reliably researched, composed, edited, and published articles within a timely

    <h3>Arts and Culture Editor</h3>
    <h4>The Retriever Newspaper – University of Maryland, Baltimore County</h4>
    <h5>November 2019 – May 2022</h5>
    
    <p>I wrote and edited articles for the Arts and Culture section of the paper, working closely with my writers to
