      <!--More here about yourself-->
      <p class="lead">My name is Julian Ford, and I'm a first-year graduate student at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism.
        Language, composition and storytelling have been passions of mine for as long as I can remember, and I also have a particular fondness
        for research and data translation. 
        I've had had several articles published in the Baltimore Fishbowl and the Washington City Paper from 2022 to the present, as well as short fiction works 
        that have been published in various online journals. If I had it my way, every article I wrote would be 10,000 words long.
        When not working on school assignments, I'm usually writing, reading, playing guitar, or enjoying the occasional video game.
